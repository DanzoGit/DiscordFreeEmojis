# DiscordFreeEmojis

If you don't have nitro, post the emojis as links!<br>

Install it by downloading the DiscordFreeEmoji.plugin.js file to plugins folder.<br>
- Windows: `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\plugins`
<br>

A fork of An00nymushun's original: https://github.com/An00nymushun/DiscordFreeEmojis <br>

Changes made:
- (Breaking Bug) emoji.url no longer exists, url is created dynamically based on if emoji is animated gif or still webp.
- (QOL) Url is inserted as a hyperlink on an invisible character (may be visible on mobile or certain fonts)
- (Pref) Emojis are displayed in their native size, they are not limited to 48 or 64px (if you want it limited, use the 64px version)

I intend to maintain this repo as I use the plugin. I will consider any PRs or issues.
